# Contributing Guide
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Reporting Bugs
Report bugs right through the [GitHub issue tracker.](https://github.com/alex-taxiera/eris-boiler/issues)

__Great__ Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce, _be specific!_
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Submitting Changes
We use [GitHub Flow!](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
1. Fork from `master`
2. Name your branch something specific to your contribution. e.g. `fix-this-bug`
3. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Issue your PR once you are ready for code review

## Style
We use [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) style guide, this means two spaces for indenting. There are StandardJS packages for most editors out there as well as a command line tool to check before you submit any PRs. Linting CI is set up, so we will see this right away.
